# Resources

This is not a definitive guide. Cyber Security is an evolving field with infinite knowledge. However, from our experience, covering this roadmap of resources (which is a lot btw) will give you a good grasp of most concepts to make you skilled enough to explore and understand more advanced stuff yourself.

To understand how to exploit, you must first understand the target you are exploiting. This makes the field huge, as you must first have some knowledge of development of the stuff you are attacking. That said, many resources are freely available on the internet with just information to not overwhelm you while giving useful important.

As with learning anything, only reading won't take you anywhere and you'll have to practice to understand things. All the best!

## <u>General</u>

### `Linux`
Being comfortable in using Linux is an important first task for every hacker. Understanding of filesystems, processes, users and security principles is also a must. Skill in Bash Scripting will also help you automate lots of tasks while testing.
#### Learning
The best way to learn linux is to use it, constantly, only with the terminal. Instead of trying to go back to other OS or GUI tools, force yourself to search and learn how to do something via terminal.
